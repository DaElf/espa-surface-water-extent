NOTE:  Some of the contents of this email have been superceded.

The model relies on a series of relatively simple and efficient water
detection tests, each with their own output code for a “positive” test
result or 0 for a negative test result. This result is output as its own
composite band. Then, a series of “revisions” based on CFMASK data
in the CDR and percent slope from a DEM are also performed to generate
additional DSWE output bands. Finally, the ancillary percent slope input
is also provided in the output product.



Succinctly stated, a one sentence version of the “Raw DSWE” decision
rule is as follows:

1 (if MNDWI >= WIGT) + 10 (if MBSRV > MBSRN) + 100 (if AWEsh > AWGT) + 1000 (if MNDWI > PSWT AND TM_band5 < PSWB5T AND TM_band4 < PSWB4T) otherwise 0.



Data Inputs

1) LSRP TM_band1, TM_band2, TM_band3, TM_band4, TM_band5, TM_band6 and
   band 17. (Scaled in the form that is provisionally distributed).

2) Elevation Data Model (or percent slope if you prefer calculating percent
   slope outside this model) that has been clipped to each scene.



Output

A 6 band file, each containing (with possible output ranges being):

1) Raw DSWE (potential value range 0 - 1111).

2) CFMASK cloud and cloud shadow revised band 1 (DSWE)
   (potential value range 0 – 1111 plus a code for “no_data”).

3) CFMASK snow-revised band 2
   (i.e., cloud and cloud shadow revised DSWE plus a code for “no_data”)

4) Slope revised band 3
   (i.e., snow, cloud and cloud shadow revised DSWE)
   (potential value range 0 - 1111 plus a code value for "no_data").

5) Percent Slope (potential range scene dependent).



Variables derived within the program and on which "decisions" are made: 

1) From LSRP: Modified Normalized Difference Wetness Index (MNDWI):

   MNDWI = (TM_band2 - TM_band5) / (TM_band2 + TM_band5)

2) From LSRP: Multi-band Spectral Relationship Visible (MBSRV).

   MBSRV = (TM_band2 + TM_band3)

3) From LSRP: Multi-band Spectral Relationship Near-Infrared (MBSRN).

   MBSRN = (TM_band4 + TM_band5)

4) From LSRP: Automated Water Extent shadow (AWEsh).

   AWEsh = TM_band1 + 2.5 * TM_band2 - 1.5 * (TM_band4 + TM_band5) - 0.25 * TM_band6

5) From MNDWI (above) and other LSRP bands: Partial Surface Water (PSW).
   (Presented as a conditional statement).

   PSW = MNDWI > PSWT AND TM_band5 < PSWB5T AND TM_band4 < PSWB4T

6) From digital elevation data clipped to scene boundary:
   Percent Slope (PERSLP).



A separate decision rules listing to generate DSWE (in case that’s useful)

A single string was provided above for the decision rule. But in practice
I generate temporary, separate files in memory for each conditional
rule with the output codes shown below. Then I add those temporary files
to produce a composite score for each pixel in the image. This creates
“band 1” of the output.


1 (if MNDWI >= WIGT) otherwise 0

10 (if MBSRV > MBSRN) otherwise 0

100 (if AWEsh > AWGT) otherwise 0

1000 (if MNDWI > PSWT AND TM_band5 < PSWB5T AND TM_band4 < PSWB4T) otherwise 0



Parameter inputs

*The current thresholds used for most decisions have been quite stable
but I would like the flexibility to modify them either by over-riding
the default value via a command string or by providing them dynamically
as the result from another (as of yet untested) routine (the later may
be a long term goal for the ECV).


I name these parameters below (with names that make sense to me anyway)
and provide default values. (Let me know if my naming scheme creates
any problems or you would like to suggest improvements).



Parameter Name: type and range: default value

1) WIGT:
   A floating point (3 decimal values) number between 0.000 and 2.000 : 0.015

2) AWGT:
   A floating point (2 decimal values) number between -2.00 and 2.00 : 0.00

3) PSWT:
   A floating point (2 decimal values) number between -2.00 and 2.00 : -0.05

4) PSWB4T:
   Signed 10-bit number between 0 and scene maximum : 1500

5) PSWB5T:
   Signed 10-bit number between 0 and scene maximum : 1000

5) PSLPT:
   A floating point (2 decimal values) between 0.00 and 100.00



Cloud  and shadow revision (output band 2)

The CFMASK band (band 17 in the LSRP) is used to convert potential
cloud (band17 value “4”) and shadow pixels (band17 value “2”)
to "no_data value" and all other pixels to the value of Raw DSWE.


I’m open to suggestions for the no_data value (other than “0” -
that's already reserved). I believe ArcMAP uses -9999 but you can tell me
whether this does very bad things to the output file size! I will write
that the no_data value needs to be something that is easy to distinguish
as "no data" as I'll combine the result with evaluation data that can
have large positive values (in the hundreds of thousands).



Snow revision (output band 3)

The CFMASK band (band 17 in the LSRP) is used to convert potentially
snow covered pixel (band17 value “3”) in output band 2 (cloud/shadow
revised) to "no_data value" and all others to Raw DSWE.



Slope revision (output band 4)

Percent slope is consulted to flag all pixels with slope greater than
PSLPT to 0 (not “no data”) and all other pixels to their band 3 value.



Slope (output band 5)

Finally, percent slope is scaled by 100 and output as an integer value.



I'm looking forward to churning out lots of additional test data Ron.


Thanks!
